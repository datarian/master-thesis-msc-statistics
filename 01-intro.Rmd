# Introduction {#intro}

This thesis proposes a solution of the KDD Cup of the year 1998, in which the responses to a fundraising campaign are to be analysed with the goal of improving cost-effectiveness for future campaigns. This is to be achieved through the development of a model to help maximize the net revenue of future direct marketing efforts.

A U.S. American veterans organization regularly conducts direct marketing campaigns, asking their members for donations for the treatment of veterans with spinal injuries. The data at hand is a subset of the roughly 3.5 million members of the organization who received a mailing in 1997. All of the donors who received this mailing were acquired by the organization through similar premium-oriented appeals such as this one.

The donors are grouped, among other criteria, by the recency of their last donation. According to the cup's documentation, one group is of particular interest. These are the so-called *lapsed* donors. These are individuals who made their last donation to the organisation 13 to 24 months prior to the 1997 mailing. The importance of this group lies in the fact that the longer an individual goes without donation, the less likely it is to donate again in the future [TODO: Find reference on phenomenon].

The organization has furthermore found that there is an negative correlation between the dollar amount donated and the likelihood to respond to a mailing. This means it is important to include the most unlikely donors in future mailings because if they donate, the net revenue is particularly large. If these unlikely donors would be suppressed from future mailings, the gains from additional small dollar lapsed donors would not offset the losses from the potential high dollar donors.

From the data and the documentation at hand, the domain in question is relational marketing.

## Problem to solve

A data analysis is to be carried out, answering the cup's question using the programming language Python @CS-R9526.

## Python in data science

There is a range of packages available that have different levels of abstraction to conduct data science tasks. 

...

### Scikit-Learn

The module scikit-learn @scikit-learn provides high-level functions for a broad range of machine learning methods (i.e. supervised and unsupervised learning. It includes preprocessing functions, is able to do feature selection and designed for accesibility.

...

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow @tensorflow2015-whitepaper is a machine learning framework that provides an abstraction to the process of learning. It allows to build so-called *dataflow graphs*, which can be interpreted as a network of processing nodes through which data flows. Tensorflow applications are scalable and run on devices from smartphones and single machines to computing clusters.

### Established workflows

Following the principle of literate programming @knuth1984literate, Jupyter @Kluyver:2016aa provides a client-server solution that enables interactive programming sessions in the browser. Blocks of code producing output including interactive plots can be mixed with formatted text. These notebooks can easily be shared with others or exported in various formats.
