                            Second Byte of code is concerned with FREQUENCY
                            based on the period of recency.  The period of
                            recency for all groups except L and I is the
                            last 12 months.  For L it is 13-24 months ago,
                            and for I it is 25-36 months ago.  There are
                            four valid frequency codes.

                            1=One gift in the period of recency 
                            2=Two gift in the period of recency 
                            3=Three gifts in the period of recency 
                            4=Four or more gifts in the period of recency

                            Third byte of the code is the Amount of the last
                            gift.
