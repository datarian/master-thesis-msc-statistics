## Python Environment

Python was installed through the Anaconda distribution

Most of the programming was done interactively in jupyter notebooks.

A python package for handling the loading of datasets was developed separately and the called from the notebooks.

                            1st 2 bytes of the code refers to the year of the 
                            mailing while 3rd and 4th bytes refer to the 
                            following promotion codes/types:

                            This information could certainly be used to calculate 
                            several summary variables that count the number of 
                            occurrences of various types of promotions received 
                            in the most recent 12-36 months, etc. 

                            RFA (RECENCY/FREQUENCY/AMOUNT)
                            ------------------------------
 
                            The RFA (recency/frequency/amount) status of the 
                            donors (as of the promotion dates) is included in the 
                            RFA fields.
 
                            The (current) concatenated version is a nominal 
                            or symbolic field. The individual bytes could 
                            separately be used as fields and refer to the 
                            following: 

                            First Byte of code is concerned with RECENCY
                            based on Date of the last Gift

                            F=FIRST TIME DONOR Anyone who has made their
                              first donation in the last 6 months and has
                              made just one donation.

                            N=NEW DONOR Anyone who has made their first
                              donation in the last 12 months and is not a
                              First time donor.  This is everyone who made
                              their first donation 7-12 months ago, or
                              people who made their first donation between
                              0-6 months ago and have made 2 or more
                              donations.

                            A=ACTIVE DONOR Anyone who made their first
                              donation more than 12 months ago and has made
                              a donation in the last 12 months.

                            L=LAPSING DONOR A previous donor who made their
                              last donation between 13-24 months ago.

                            I=INACTIVE DONOR A previous donor who has not
                              made a donation in the last 24 months.  It is
                              people who made a donation 25+ months ago.

                            S=STAR DONOR STAR Donors are individuals who
                              have given to 3 consecutive card mailings.


                            Second Byte of code is concerned with FREQUENCY
                            based on the period of recency.  The period of
                            recency for all groups except L and I is the
                            last 12 months.  For L it is 13-24 months ago,
                            and for I it is 25-36 months ago.  There are
                            four valid frequency codes.

                            1=One gift in the period of recency 
                            2=Two gift in the period of recency 
                            3=Three gifts in the period of recency 
                            4=Four or more gifts in the period of recency

                            Third byte of the code is the Amount of the last
                            gift.
